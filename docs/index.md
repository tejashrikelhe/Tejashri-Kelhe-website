    <p>Hi! I am <strong>Tejashri Kelhe</strong>, an AI systems expert and Software Engineer specializing in the full-stack development of production Machine Learning systems. I focus on algorithmic optimization and distributed computing to architect and deploy high-throughput, low-latency systems. My mission is to efficiently scale advanced AI research into robust, high-performance, and mission-critical solutions.</p>

    My approach integrates the analytical rigor of a Data Scientist (understanding the problem and data), the scalability mindset of a Software Engineer (building robust, maintainable systems), and the production focus of an Machine Learning Engineer (deploying and managing models at scale). The common thread is always optimization for performance, cost, and accuracy.
