# About

I design and ship ML systems that connect academic rigor with production needs.

Currently, I work at **Texas A&M AgriLife Research** on distributed and hybrid AI systems that model **spatiotemporal disease spread** across livestock and wildlife. These are agent-based and data-driven models used to guide **biosecurity interventions** and **policy decisions**.

Before that, at **Micron Technology**, I worked on **real-time Machine Learning for semiconductor manufacturing**:
- Low-latency and High throughput models
- sub 30 ms computer vision inference on embedded devices
- graph ML + Bayesian optimization to reduce defective chip manufacturing by ~30 percent
- secure REST-based ML integration with factory control (C++ backend)

At **AT&T**, I built **low-latency anomaly detection and fraud risk scoring microservices** (LSTM + XGBoost + FastAPI + AWS Lambda) that served **millions** of daily calls and were tied to real A/B test loops via MLflow.

I also collaborated with **MIT Lincoln Laboratory** on cross-domain audio/image ML benchmarking and large-scale training on GPU clusters.

My research interests:
- Deep learning architecture design and optimization
- Scalable and efficient machine learning pipelines 
- Bayesian and causal inference for real-world decision systems
- Explainable, transparent, and responsible AI
- Applied machine learning for operational domains (finance, telecommunications, semiconductors, and healthcare)
