# Research, Publications, and Peer Review

My research sits at the intersection of **Bayesian ML**, **causal modeling**, and **hybrid AI** for real-world decision systems.

## Current Themes
- Hybrid models: combining agent-based simulation with deep learning
- Bayesian LSTM for geospatial forecasting (crop yield, disease spread)
- Graph ML + optimization for industrial systems
- Responsible and explainable AI for high-stakes inference
