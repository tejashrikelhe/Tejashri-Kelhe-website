### Summary
This invention automates feature engineering for **high-dimensional tabular data** using a multi-head self-attention mechanism. Instead of manually crafting and selecting features, the system **learns which features and feature interactions matter most** before model training.

### Key Problem It Solves
Traditional ML pipelines struggle with:
- very large numbers of input features
- expensive manual feature selection
- loss of important nonlinear interactions

This approach uses **attention to select relevant features first**, so models become **faster, lighter, and more accurate**.

### Impact
- Reduces computational and memory costs for deep learning on tabular/industrial data
- Improves model generalization by suppressing noisy or redundant features
- Makes feature selection **data-driven and explainable**

### Industry Applications
- Financial and payment risk modeling
- Semiconductor manufacturing and fab optimization
- E-commerce personalization and ranking
- Precision healthcare and diagnostics
- Any domain with **high-stakes, high-dimensional** tabular data
